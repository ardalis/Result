# Getting Started

If you're building an ASP.NET Core Web API you can simply install the [Ardalis.Result.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ardalis.Result.AspNetCore/) package to get started. Then, apply the `[TranslateResultToActionResult]` attribute to any actions or controllers that you want to automatically translate from Result types to ActionResult types.
